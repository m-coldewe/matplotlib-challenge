# Pymaceuticals Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. Utilyzes Python, version, 3.10, along with libraries: Matplotlib, Pandas, and Scipy Stats.

## Purpose

To compare the performance of Capomulin, I generated the following:

- Summary statisctics for each drug regimen
- Bar chart
- Pie chart showing the distribution of male versus female mice in the study
- Box plot for the four most promising treatment regimens with outliers
- Line plot tracking the tumor volume of a single mouse treated with Capomulin
- Scatter plot showing mouse weight vs. average observed tumor volume for the mice treated with Capomulin
- Correlation and linear regression for weight vs. average observed tumor volume for the mice treated with Capomulin

In order to generate these visualizations accurately, I received help from my TA, Carlos. Specifically, he helped me with generateing the summary statistics, the first bar chart, calculating the quartiles and finding the outliers, and troubleshooting the funky results generated in the line plot.

## Result

Capomulin performed competitively with Ramicane. Both Capomulin and Ramicane produced Mean Tumor Volumes of 40.675 and 40.217, respectively, compared to the next nearest regimen, Propriva, which had a Mean Tumor Volume of 52.320. Drug Regimens Ketapril, Naftisol, and Stelasyn all produced Mean Tumor Volumes which exceeded the numbers proceeded by the Placeebo.

Explain the results of the analysis.
